# Intro to Tendem

Tendem is a new kind of hybrid agent, where human insight meets the speed and scale of AI. By combining the breadth of language models with the nuance, judgment, and care that only humans can provide, we're creating something truly powerful.

Together, we will tackle tasks that demand accuracy, creativity, and thoughtful decision-making—from fact-checking scientific claims to gathering market insights or building trustworthy sales lists.

**Tendem’s task lines**
Tendem has two main workflow lines: General and Vibecode.

You have been selected for the **Vibecode line**.

Each line features a two-stage selection process: Newbies and Junior.

[Lets start]

# Vibecode newbies stage

At this stage, you will complete two domain-specific test tasks (up to 10 hours total).

> These tasks are carried out using a separate interface — not our main AI agent platform — so we can assess your abilities in a neutral environment.

Upon successfully completing both tasks and meeting our quality standards, you will receive a compensation of $50.

Our review process ensures quality work, and may take varying amounts of time depending on our team’s capacity. However, rest assured that if your work meets our standards, you will receive payment — we guarantee compensation for all approved submissions.

For more information about payments, visit our Payment Help Center.

# Read task carefully

Before starting, review the task description thoroughly. Pay close attention to formatting requirements, data sources, file structure, column names, and any specific instructions (e.g., axis labels, arrow placements, or required fields).

# Plan your approach

Before diving into a task, take a moment to think about how you can optimize and accelerate your work. Break down the task into steps and identify which tools or automation could save you time and effort.

**The key principle:** Always ask yourself first—"How can I do this smarter, not harder?" Then leverage tools and AI to execute efficiently.

# Choose the right tools

**For data research tasks:** Use reliable sources like official surveys, government databases, or verified publications. Cross-reference data to ensure accuracy. If you're unsure how to find the best sources or automate the research process, ask an external LLM for recommendations.

**For web scraping tasks:** Leverage automation tools (e.g., Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or browser automation tools) to speed up data collection and reduce manual work. If you're not familiar with specific tools for your use case, consult an LLM to find the best solution.

**For data visualization:** Use Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to create clear, well-labeled charts that meet all specified requirements. Again, if you need guidance on the best approach or libraries, don't hesitate to ask an external LLM.

**The key principle:** Always ask yourself first—"How can I do this smarter, not harder?" Then leverage tools and AI to execute efficiently. You're expected to be resourceful and use every available resource to deliver quality results quickly.

# Verify your results

Double-check all data points before submission. If the task requires email addresses, phone numbers, or other information, verify that they are real, active, and correctly formatted—do not use placeholder or fictional data.

Review your output files (CSV, graphs, etc.) to ensure they match the required structure and naming conventions.

# Leverage AI and external tools

As a Vibecode expert, you’re expected to use AI models, automation scripts, and external platforms to work faster and smarter. Don’t hesitate to combine tools—LLMs for research and data processing, APIs for scraping, and code libraries for visualization.

# Quality over speed

Take the time needed to deliver accurate, complete, and well-organized results. Rushing through tasks can lead to errors that affect your evaluation. Aim for precision, clarity, and attention to detail in every submission.

# What’s next

If you successfully complete your Vibecode Newbies test tasks (the two test assignments ahead of you), you'll receive an invitation to join **Vibecode Junior**. At that stage, we'll provide detailed guidance on our AI agent interface, how to work with it, and what types of tasks you'll encounter. On the Junior line, you'll complete up to 10 tasks so we can evaluate the quality and consistency of your work over a longer period.

As a reminder, your current test tasks are completed in a separate interface without our AI agent—this gives us a clean baseline to assess your capabilities. Once you move to Junior, you'll start working directly with our platform.

Good luck with your test tasks—we hope to see you on Vibecode Junior!
