# Pricing Psychology & Willingness-to-Pay Guidance

## 1. The Psychology of Value
Founders do not buy "time." They buy **Speed** and **Certainty**.
*   **Cheap = Risky**: If you charge $500/mo, a founder assumes you are a novice. It is "too cheap to be good."
*   **Expensive = Safe**: If you charge $5,000/mo, you are a "strategic asset."

### The "Mochary Anchor"
Matt Mochary (CEO Coach to Coinbase, OpenAI) charges publicly high rates (~$10k-$100k equity equivalents).
*   **Strategy**: Use this as the "Price Anchor." You offer the same *methodology* (drastic accountability) for a fraction of the "Celebrity Coach" price.

## 2. Recommended Pricing Structures

### A. The "Clean" Retainer (Recommended)
*   **Price**: **$2,500 - $5,000 per month**.
*   **Terms**: Month-to-month. Cancel anytime.
*   **Why it works**: Founders hate long contracts. "Cancel anytime" signals extreme confidence in your value. It removes the risk of "buying a mistake."
*   **Psychology**: It's roughly the cost of a junior employee or a few SaaS subscriptions. It falls under "Professional Development" or "Consulting" budgets easily.

### B. The "Hybrid" Model (Cash + Equity)
*   **Price**: **$1,500/mo + 0.25% Advisory Shares**.
*   **Why it works**: It aligns incentives. "I only win if you exit."
*   **Risk**: Complex legal paperwork. Only do this for late-stage founders you truly believe in.

### C. The "Performance" Sprint
*   **Price**: **$10,000 flat fee for 90 days**.
*   **Focus**: "The Q1 Execution Sprints."
*   **Why it works**: Bypasses monthly approval fatigue. It's a one-time Project Expense (CapEx vs OpEx mindset).

## 3. Formatting the Price: "Do's and Don'ts"

| Strategy | The Wrong Way (Freelancer) | The Right Way (Partner) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Presentation** | "My hourly rate is $250." | "The Monthly Executive Retainer is $3k." |
| **Justification** | "I work 4 sessions a month." | "We ensure you hit your Q3 KPI." |
| **Discounts** | "I can do $2k if that helps?" | "We don't discount. But you can cancel day 1." |
| **Invoicing** | "Net 30 invoice sent via PayPal." | "Auto-charge Stripe subscription." |

## 4. Founder Reactions to Promos (The "Discount Paradox")
*   **Scenario**: You offer 50% off your first month.
*   **Founder Reaction**: "Why? Is he desperate? Is his calendar empty?"
*   **The Paradox**: Discounts *lower* conversion rates with high-status buyers. They signal low demand.
*   **Alternative**: Instead of a discount, offer a **"Strategy Audit"** (Value Add). "I'll review your Q3 plan for free before we start." This demonstrates expertise, not desperation.

## 5. Willingness-to-Pay Benchmarks (US Market 2024)

| Service Tier | Price Range | Client perception |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Therapy / Life Coach** | $150 - $400 / mo | "Personal expense." Hesitant to put on company card. |
| **Executive Coach (Junior)** | $1,000 - $2,000 / mo | "Nice to have." First thing cut during budget cuts. |
| **Strategic Partner (You)** | **$3,000 - $6,000 / mo** | **"Operational necessity."** Kept even during layoffs. |
| **"Guru" / Celebrity** | $10,000+ / mo | Status symbol. Buying the network, not just the coaching. |

**Source Data**:
*   US Executive Coaching median rates range from $250 - $500+ per hour ($2k-$4k/mo equivalent) [1].
*   High-end tech coaching (Series A+) routinely exceeds $5,000/mo for "high touch" engagement [2].
