# Implementation Plan: Founder Accountability Service Research

## Goal Description
Conduct deep behavioral research to inform the marketing, messaging, and channel strategy for a new founder-focused Accountability Partner service. The goal is to maximize conversion from post-seed founders by understanding their pains, buying behavior, and effective channels.

## User Review Required
- **Verification of Findings**: Since I cannot access private communities or paid reports, findings will be based on public data (blogs, forums, podcasts, social media).
- **Competitor List**: I will identify top competitors, but "top 12" might be subject to availability of public info.

## Research Strategy

### 1. Buyer Psychology & Pains
**Sources**: Reddit (r/startups, r/entrepreneur), Indie Hackers, Twitter/X (advanced search for "founder burnout", "lonely founder", "CEO coach help"), YC Hacker News.
**Queries**:
- "founder burnout help reddit"
- "startups looking for accountability partner"
- "why I hired a CEO coach"
- "struggles of post-seed founders"
- "founder loneliness reddit"

### 2. Competitor & Category Analysis
**Sources**: Product Hunt, Google Search, curated lists of coaching services.
**Target Competitors**:
- Executive coaches (Torch, BetterUp - though enterprise focused, relevant for comparison)
- Founder-specific coaches (Jerry Colonna/Reboot, Matt Mochary - high end benchmarks)
- Accountability groups (Focusmate - low end, but relevant behavior)
- "Accountability Partner" specific services.

### 3. Pricing & Packaging
**Sources**: Pricing pages of identified competitors, transparent startup revenue metrics (Open Startups), forum discussions on "how much for coaching".
**Queries**:
- "executive coaching pricing for startups"
- "how much do founders pay for accountability"
- "retainer vs hourly coaching startup"

### 4. Channels & Messaging
**Sources**: Where do target founders hang out?
- specific substacks (Lenny's Newsletter consumers??)
- Podcast sponsors (who sponsors "My First Million" or "SaaStr"?)
- LinkedIn ad library (if accessible via search text) for competitor ads.
