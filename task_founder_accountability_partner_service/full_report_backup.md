### Detailed Competitor Profiles

**1. Mochary Method (The Standard)**

Matt Mochary is the most famous coach in tech (Coinbase, OpenAI). *Positioning*: "We teach you how to run a company." *Weakness*: Inaccessible waitlists and extremely high price ($12,000/mo+). *Opportunity*: Take his "infrastructure" approach but make it accessible.

**2. Reboot.io (The Soul)**

Famous for "Jerry Colonna" and the emotional side of leadership. *Positioning*: "Better Humans Make Better Leaders." *Weakness*: Can feel too much like therapy for founders who just want to ship product. *Opportunity*: Sell "Hard Skills" and "Execution."

**3. Hampton (The Network)**

Sam Parr's community for high-growth founders. *Positioning*: "Your personal board of advisors." *Weakness*: It's peer-to-peer, meaning the advice varies in quality. *Opportunity*: Offer professional, guaranteed accountability, not just peer chats.

**4. Vistage (The Legacy)**

Massive peer group organization. *Positioning*: "World's largest CEO coaching organization." *Weakness*: Skews older, non-tech, brick-and-mortar. *Opportunity*: Be the "Modern/Tech" version.

**5. Chief (The Executive Network)**

Women's leadership network. *Positioning*: "The only private membership network focused on connecting and supporting women executive leaders." *Weakness*: Focuses broadly on VP/C-suite corporate types, not just gritty startup founders.

**6. Torch (The Platform)**

Software for L&D. *Positioning*: "People development platform." *Weakness*: Feels corporate and HR-driven. *Opportunity*: Be the "anti-platform" — bespoke and personal.

**7. Sounding Board (The Manager Coach)**

Scalable coaching for enterprises. *Positioning*: "Leadership coaching for the modern enterprise." *Weakness*: Designed for middle-managers, not the lonely CEO at the top.

**8. Commit Action (The Task Master)**

Accountability coaching. *Positioning*: "The personal trainer for your productivity." *Weakness*: Focuses on "getting things done" (tasks) rather than "doing the right things" (strategy).

**9. Focusmate (The Body Double)**

Virtual co-working. *Positioning*: "Distraction-free productivity." *Weakness*: Transactional. You are just watching each other work. No strategic guidance.

**10. Operators Guild (The COO Club)**

Community for operators. *Positioning*: "For the people who run the company." *Weakness*: Excludes the CEO.

**11. Dave Bailey (The Series A Coach)**

Famous writings on Medium. *Positioning*: "Founder Coach." *Weakness*: Often books by the hour or session, which feels transactional.
