## A. Buyer Psychology & Pain
**Top 5 Recurring Pains (US Founders):**
1.  **Isolation ("The Void")**: "I cannot tell my team I'm scared, and I cannot tell my investors I'm lost."
2.  **Decision Paralysis**: The fear that *one* wrong decision will kill the company after a $5M seed round.
3.  **Imposter Syndrome**: 71% of CEOs feel they are "faking it" [1].
4.  **Operational Chaos**: "We have revenue but no process. We are scaling chaos."
5.  **Co-Founder Friction**: Unspoken resentment about uneven workload.

**Dominant Emotions**:
-   **Fear**: Of losing other people's money (Angel/VC funds).
-   **Shame**: Of "failing" despite external vanity metrics (TechCrunch article vs. Empty Bank Account).
-   **Exhaustion**: "Decision fatigue" is a top complaint in founder well-being reports [5].
