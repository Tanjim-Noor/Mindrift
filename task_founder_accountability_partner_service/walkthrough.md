# Research Walkthrough: Founder Accountability Research

I have completed the deep behavioral research for your Founder Accountability Service. As requested, the findings are separated into **5 distinct files**.

## 📂 deliverables (DOCX & MD Available)

> **verified**: All files below have been converted to **.docx** format in your folder for final submission.

**Start Here.** A 1-page high-level verdict on market viability.
