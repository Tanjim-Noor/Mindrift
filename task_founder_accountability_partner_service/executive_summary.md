# Executive Summary: Founder Accountability Partner Service

## Market Diagnosis: The "Missing Middle"
The market for "founder help" is bifurcated. Data from 2024 shows that founders either pay **$12k+/mo** for elite coaches like Matt Mochary [1] or rely on low-value "accountability buddies." There is a massive gap for **Post-Seed/Series A founders** who need operational rigor at a **$2k-$5k/mo** price point [2].

**Value Prop**: "The External Chief of Staff." Not therapy, but an **operational system** to manage decision debt.

## Top 10 Actionable Insights

### Messaging & Positioning
1.  **Reframe "Coaching" to "Infrastructure"**: Don't sell "sessions." Sell a "Weekly Business Review (WBR) System."
2.  **The "War Room" Pivot**: Replace "safe space" with "War Room." Founders want to fight and win, not heal.
3.  **Kill "Work-Life Balance"**: Replace it with "Sustainable Performance." Founders reject "balance" as weakness but accept "longevity" as strategy.
4.  **The "Founder-Friendly" Retainer**: Price at **$2,500/mo**. This fits on a corporate card without Board approval.
5.  **Radical Truth**: Your differentiation is that you are the *only* person who can tell them "That idea is bad" without getting fired.

### Sales & Acquisition
6.  **The 90-Day Sprint**: Sell a 3-month "Sprint" to fix a specific problem (e.g., "Fix Sales Hiring") rather than an open-ended "relationship."
7.  **Target "Post-Fundraising" Moments**: Outreach immediately after a funding announcement on TechCrunch. This is peak anxiety ("Now I have to deliver").
8.  **Leverage Investor Referrals**: Pitch VC Operating Partners. They want their portfolio founders to have coaches but can't pay $10k/mo.
9.  **The "Audit" Hook**: Sell a $500 "Operational Audit" first. If they sign the retainer, credit it back.
10. **Use "Tear-down" Content**: Publish anonymous "Before/After" calendars of founders you've helped. Show the chaos turned to order.

## 3 Immediate A/B Tests to Run

### Test 1: The Value Hook (Website Headline)
*   **Variant A (Traditional)**: "Executive Coaching for High-Growth Founders."
*   **Variant B (Operational)**: "The External Chief of Staff for Founders who need to ship."
*   **Hypothesis**: Variant B will convert 2x better because it solves a *bandwidth* problem, not just a *personal* one.

### Test 2: The Pricing Anchor (Sales Deck)
*   **Variant A**: "$2,500/mo (Compare to Therapy)."
*   **Variant B**: "$2,500/mo (Compare to a Bad VP Hire @ $25k/mo)."
*   **Hypothesis**: Variant B makes the service feel cheap by anchoring against a business cost, not a personal one.

### Test 3: The Cold Outreach Subject Line
*   **Variant A**: "Coaching for [Company Name]?"
*   **Variant B**: "Your Weekly Business Review."
*   **Hypothesis**: Variant B gets higher open rates because it sounds like an internal operational email, triggering a "this is urgent" response.

## Strategic Recommendations
*   **Go-To-Market**: Focus on "Indie Hackers" podcasts and "Building in Public" on Twitter. These channels have high trust and low CAC [3].
*   **Verification**: Ensure you have "Battle Scars." You must demonstrate you have fired people or failed.
